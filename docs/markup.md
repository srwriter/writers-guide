Markdown is a [**markup language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language)
used in technical writing to create text that is readable in raw format and the final output.

Technical documents are often written in Markdown to simplify repurposing content for various sources: manuals, guides, reports, and other reference materials.

> Writing in markdown is easy to learn. Symbols mark wether text is a heading, bold, italic, a link, and so on. For example, 1 hashtag followed by text (# heading) creates a large heading like this:

# Heading
